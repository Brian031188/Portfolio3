## Brian Forristal's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal website where I host my personal R projects. While studying at the University of
Pittsburgh, through directed learning in courses and for fun in my personal time, I've developed my skills in statistics, data science, and coding. Have fun looking through my journey in data science and statistics.

## Goals
1. Be the best dad I can be :)
2. Hoping to find a meaningful job in data science and statistics where I can make positive change.
3. Change the world!
