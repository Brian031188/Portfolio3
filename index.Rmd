## Who am I?

My name is Brian Forristal and welcome to my personal website. Here, I host various coding examples I've learned along the way to discovery data science and statistics applications. I am currently a full-time student at the University of Pittsburgh, a Marine Corps veteran, and father to ten-month old Sofia (picture left). Despite my major of statistics, I have focused my free time to learning integral components to the data-science workflow beyond my studies. I believe it is paramount to be well-rounded and knowledgeable in many disciplines, that way I can maximize my contributions to the team. 

## Goals
1. Be the best dad I can be :)
2. Hoping to find a meaningful job in data science and statistics where I can make positive change.
3. Change the world!
