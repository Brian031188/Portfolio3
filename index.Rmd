# **Brian Forristal's Portfolio**

Welcome to my personal website where I host my personal R projects. While studying at the University of
Pittsburgh, through directed learning in courses and for fun in my personal time, I've developed my skills in statistics, data science, and coding. Have fun looking through my journey in data science and statistics.

## How to use

1. fork the repo for this website and follow instructions on read me to get set up. [https://github.com/CrumpLab/LabJournalWebsite](https://github.com/CrumpLab/LabJournalWebsite)

2. Blog/journal what you are doing in R, by editing the Journal.Rmd. See the [Journal page](https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/Journal.html) for an example of what to do to get started learning R.

3. See the [links page](https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/Links.html) for lots of helpful links on learning R.

4. Change everything to make it your own.
